            <h2><strong>Wall drops 30 points in Wizards comeback</strong></h2>
            
            <p>A lot of turmoil has been surfaced in the Washington Wizards lockerroom recently. They have been off to a slow start to the season being 5-11 and superstars John Wall and Bradley Beal were rumored to be on the trade block after a heated practice session. During practice, Wall had allegedly yelled at the head coach Scott Brooks. When asked about this, Coach Brooks addressed the fact that he wants the team to put this all behind them stating "We talked about it, we move on. I'm not here to throw anything in anybody's face." Bradley Beal explained that there is still "A lot of stuff to fix".</p>
            
            <p>The Wizards went on the road in California where they were away to the Los Angeles Clippers. They were off to a slow start trailing by 24 points halfway through the second quarter. Bradley Beal was getting heated with Austin Rivers, who was recently traded from the Clippers, for a foul call. John Wall was also getting fired up at Jeff Green. However the Washington side did not give in to the pressure. Instead they thrived throughout the game. John Wall scored 30 points with Bradley Beal scoring 20. From then on it was all going downhill for the LA Clippers, with guard Lou Williams getting ejected for the first time in his career. The Wizards pulled away with the win on a scoreline of 125-118, and putting an end to the Clippers five game winning streak in the process.</p>
