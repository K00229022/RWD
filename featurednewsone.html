            <h2><strong>Kyrie drops 43 points in a thriller over the Raptors</strong></h2>
            
            <p>All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving finished the Boston Celtics home game against the Toronto Raptors making 18 shots out of 26, recording 43 points along with 11 assists. Up until this point he had never gone past 40 points or 10 assists.</p>
            
            <p>Irving opened up the game with two big three pointers, a two point jumpshot and a lay-up. In the second half things were only getting better for him, as he was sinking more jumpshots and driving to the basket. With his team down he converted in a layup to bring the game to overtime. When the game was brought to overtime, Irving was gathering loose balls and finishing to the basket. With just under two minutes to play in the game he knocked down a jumpshot to secure the win for the Celtics.</p>
            
            <p>Celtics head coach Brad Stevens shares his thoughts saying that when Kyrie Irving gets into a rhythm that is when his gameplan works and everything starts to go right for his team. However in certain moments, it may have seemed that Irving's efforts may not bring the team up to surface. The Toronto Raptors are at the top of the Eastern Conference and have been since the start of the season. With less than one minute to go in the game, Toronto lead by 4 points and it seemed that they were going to take this one. But suddenly, Gordon Hayward who just came back from a season ending injury last season, played tremendous defence, getting a steal and handing it to his teammate Jason Tatum who finished the play with a dunk. With just under 30 seconds left to go in the game Hayward drew a foul and converted two free throws. The Celtics made over half of their shots and managed to secure a win for the home crowd.</p>
