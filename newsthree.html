            <h2><strong>JR Smith departs Cleveland</strong></h2>
            
            <p>
            The Cleveland Cavaliers have formed a mutual agreement with JR Smith for him to leave their roster. The 33 year old veteran has made it clear that he is not happy with the Cavs this season, so they are currently working on a trade deal for him. The Cavs front office have released a statement saying that "The organisation wishes JR and his family well and appreciates and thanks him for his contributions to the community, to thye team and his role in the 2016 NBA Championship. Smith made it clear to Cavs general manager Koby Altman that he wants to be traded when hearing that the Cavaliers would not compete this season. After their last game, they hold a record of 2-13. Smith expressed his thoughts saying that he Doesn't think "the goal is to win" but "to lose and get lottery picks". Smith is currently being payed $14.7 million for the season and has refused overtures aimed at a buyout. He addressed the buyout proposition saying "I don't want my legacy to be remembered like that. I don't think that's fair to the trainers or equipment guys"
            </p>
            
            <p>JR Smith's teammate Kevin Love expressed his thoughts about him being traded and wishing his friend the best saying "It's tough to lose a guy like that, especially when you've been in the trenches with him, been to war with him. He was a fan favourite, and he was a guy who played both sides of the ball. We all wish him the best and we all love him." Smith and Love are two of the last four players remaining on the 2016 championship winning squad. Although he had a few not so great moments here and there, he definitely had some memorable moments in the Cleveland jersey. It is unknown where he will play next but the legacy in Cleveland that he was part of will be cherished forever.</p>
