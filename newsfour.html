            <h2><strong>Danny Green nails buzzer beater for Raptors win</strong></h2>
            
            <p>The Toronto Raptors faced off against the Orlando Magic in a very back and forth battle. The two sides were off to slow starts offensively, with the Raptors committing eight turnovers, and the Magic missing eleven shot attempts in a row. The Raptors took an 18 point lead at the first half, managing to jump out ahead 40-22, while Orlando struggled with only 30 percent shooting. At the beginning of the second half, Evan Fournier scored six 3 pointers to tie the game at 59 a piece with just over five minutes to go in the quarter. The Magic managed to get the upper hand in the third quarter, managing to come back rom 18 points down and taking a 12 point lead. However, coming into the fourth quarter the Rapters managed to cut the lead to just two points with a scoreline of 77-75.</p>
            
            <p>At the beginning of the fourth quarter the Raptors were looking to make a comeback having trailed for most of the game. They were looking for something to get them going. This was when they had managed to put up a Jonas Valanciunas layup and a Danny Green three pointer, which gave them a three point lead with a score of 80-77. Both the scores kept going up in every posession. This was until Raptors forward Serge Ibaka hit a jumpshot at the top of the key to put his team up by 2 points. The most clutch moment happened in the last few seconds of the game, when none other than Danny Green hits a game winning three point shot to give the Raptors the win at 93-91.</p>
            
            <p>Even though the Toronto Raptors had drastic changes to their team, with former star Demar DeRozan getting traded for Kawhi Leonard, and the firing of former head coach Dwayne Casey, this team has managed to stay afloat. While other high ranked teams appear to be struggling, this team is thriving through the season.</p>
