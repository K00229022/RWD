            <h2><strong>Giannis and the Bucks dominates against Denver</strong></h2>
            
            <p>
            The Milwaukee Bucks played a stormer of a game against the Denver Nuggets. One of the main leaders for the Bucks was Khris Middleton, who is having a phenomenal season. He has been on fire from beyond the three point line throughout the season, however in this game it didn't seem to be his day, as he missed seven three pointers. Aswell as this he fumbled a pass to Giannis Antetokounmpo with 30 seconds left in the game. By this time the Bucks were just barely holding onto a 3 point lead. Things started to turn around for Middleton in the last few seconds of the game. While being pressured by the Nuggets defence, he took a step back and nailed a 3 pointer to seal the game for the Bucks.

            The game started off slow for the Bucks as they trailed in the game by 17 points early in the second quarter. The shots hadn't gone their way for the most part beyond the arc, and also missed nine free throws and had fourteen turnovers. But their will to claw their way back into a game and come out on top shows that they are something very special. Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo stated earlier in the season, "We do not want to be a good team, we want to be a great team. So far we've played amazing, and we gotta keep improving and doing even better", and the victory on Monday night had definitely shown it.

            The Bucks don't always want to be in a position where they have to come back form a huge deficit. For the majority of the season so far, they have been running away with games, which for a team like them is pretty easy. But to push themselves and each other to the limit to get a tough win against a very strong team is huge progress for the Milwaukee side as they continuue to thrive throughout the season.
