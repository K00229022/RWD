            <h2><strong>Kevin Durant and Draymond Green come to blows</strong></h2>
            
            <p>Kevin Durant and Draymond Green have had their heated moments in their three seasons together. However things started to get more escalated during their latest game against the Los Angeles Clippers. What led to the argument was in the last few seconds of the game, with the game tied at 106 a piece, Draymond Green grabbed a defensive rebound and dribbled it up the court. At this point, Kevin Durant was yelling for the ball, but Green did not pass it to him. Instead he fell and turned the ball over and the game went to overtime, in which the Warriors lost 121-116.</p>
            
            <p>After the fourth quarter Durant and Dreen were on the bench in a heated exchange of words. One remark that Green made to Durant was about his upcoming decision in free agency decision, prompting him to go next summer. He then reminded Durant that they had already won a championship without him saying something like, "We don't need you. We won without you". While the Warriors want to resign Durant next summer, this particular altercation where things got personal, may have an impact on what Durant decides to do.</p>
            
            <p>Of course Draymond Green got suspended for this heated altercation. The Warriors organisation is looking to hold on to their important pieces, and this may have cost them a vital part of the team in Kevin Durant. The two seemed to have squashed their beef now as Durant says that the Warriors feel "rejuvinated" after this altercation and are ready to move on.</p>
